These are some helpful methods I created to make things faster. I'll update this file with instructions later, I guess.

Instructions on these methods:

TOOLS.mobileTrigger(trigger, menu) - Call TOOLS.mobileTrigger with the first parameter being your nav button, the second parameter being your menu. These parameters must be jQuery objects.
